# Smart Contract and Associated Dapp Frontend Website Demo
This project is a basic smart contract called `Greeter` - which is by default setup when using the hardhat project scaffolding (referenced below).

It augments this standard contract with an event emitter which is used in the associated web dapp.

This repo has the code for the contract, code for deployment, and a js file that allows for interacting with the contract after deployment.

Note that for any deployment or interaction (test) ether will need to be obtained at the appropriate testnet faucet.

The **end result** can be seen here: https://greeter-smartcontract-frontend-stage.azurewebsites.net/

**Smart contract**: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x663C14C9a59c763D471AAc4368f9CEa6223af39f

## Usage

**Step 1:** clone the repo (the smart contract code is all in this current folder, while the frontend dapp code is all in the adjacent directory at this level)
**Step 2:** setup an alchemy node for whatever Ethereum testnet you wish to use
**Step 3:** create a local `.env` file and add in appropriate environment variables. (this is purposefully gitignore'd)

Examples to fill out would be like below: 

```
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=1234
ROPSTEN_URL="https://eth-ropsten.alchemyapi.io/v2/<YOUR ALCHHEMY KEY>"
ROPSTEN_PRIVATE_KEY="<YOUR PRIVATE KEY FOR METAMASK>"
ROPSTEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="<GET ADDRESS AFTER DEPLOY>"
```
After deployment, the address can be used in the `interact.stage.js` file.

Most of the source, usage, and details for this contract can be bets understood following the below links from Hardhat and Alchemy respectively.

# Smart Contract Frontend Website
This project is a basic webapp that connects to a smart contract on the ethereum (ropsten) network.

Most of this was created following the tutorial from Alchemy (linked below).

Additional work includes an Azure pipeline (yaml) for CI/CD (at the root of the repo), and extra components for inspecting gas prices and estimated gas usage costs for interacting with the contract.

A few random notes:

**Note 1:** The `create-react-app` is extremely hard to use with the upgrade to version 5.  I ran into tons of issues as there are breaking changes that do not allow use of the `web3` library (which is provided by alchemy).  As a result, I copied over files from Alchemy's repo rather than reluctantly try to figure out the dependency graph fixes needed for `create-react-app` version 5 (I'm not an advanced user of js or react, just trying to get basics working).   For more info: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11756#

**Note 2:** I deployed the finalized react site to Azure on a *windows* based app service plan.  This was much easier and I ran into issues with a linux based plan that again I did not want to fix or solve on a basic demo app.

## Usage

**Step 1:** clone the repo (frontend dapp code is all in this current folder, while the smart contract code is all in the adjacent directory at this level)
**Step 2:** setup an alchemy node for whatever Ethereum testnet you wish to use
**Step 3:** complete the deployment of the smart contract project (the other  project directory in this repo)
**Step 4:** create a local `.stage.env` file and add in appropriate environment variables. (this is purposefully gitignore'd)

Examples to fill out would be like below: 

```
REACT_APP_API_END_POINT=""
REACT_APP_ETHEREUM_NETWORK=""
REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_KEY="wss://eth-ropsten.alchemyapi.io/v2/<KEY>"
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0x..."
REACT_APP_ETHERSCAN_URL=""
```
**Step 5**: if deploying, modify the variables in the azure devops yaml file after setting up resources in your Azure account.
